# Principle Component Analysis
Principal component analysis is a technique for feature extraction.

When should I use PCA?
Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but arenâ€™t able to identify variables to completely remove from consideration?
Do you want to ensure your variables are independent of one another?
Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?
